History</h2><br>

OnePlus One
OnePlus was founded on 16 December 2013 by former Oppo vice-president Pete Lau and Carl Pei.[3] According to the Chinese government's documentation, the only institutional stockholder in OnePlus is Oppo Electronics.[4] Lau denied that OnePlus was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oppo and stated that Oppo Electronics and not Oppo Mobile (the phone manufacturer) is a major investor of OnePlus and that they are "in talks with other investors."[5] The company's main goal was to design a smartphone that would balance high-end quality with a lower price than other phones in its class, believing that users would "Never Settle" for the lower-quality devices produced by other companies. Lau explained that "we will never be different just for the sake of being different. Everything done has to improve the actual user experience in day-to-day use."[6][7] He also showed aspirations of being the "Muji of the tech industry", emphasizing its focus on high-quality products with simplistic, user-friendly designs.[6] Continuing Lau's association with the platform from the Oppo N1,[7] OnePlus entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Cyanogen Inc. to base its products' Android distribution upon a variant of the popular custom ROM CyanogenMod and use its trademarks outside of China.[8][9]
<br><br><br>
The company unveiled its first device, the OnePlus One, on 23 April 2014.[6] In December 2014, alongside the release of the OnePlus One in India exclusively through Amazon, OnePlus also announced plans to establish a presence in the country, with plans to open 25 official walk-in service centres across India.[10]
In April 2014, OnePlus hired Han Han as the product ambassador in mainland China.[11]

On 9 March 2014, the company expanded its operations to the European Union.[12]
<br><br><br>
On 16 December 2014, The Supreme Court of India and Delhi High Court banned the import and sales of OnePlus One phones in India following a lawsuit by Micromax alleging it has exclusivity for shipping phones with Cyanogen OS software in India.[13]
<br><br><br>
On 21 December 2014, the banning of import and selling of the device in India was lifted. The device continues to be shipped with Cyanogen OS; however, a customised version of Android specially designed by OnePlus and named OxygenOS has been released, allowing later OnePlus devices to be sold in India.[14][15]
<br><br><br>
OnePlus made its products available in Southeast Asia for the first time, partnering with Lazada Indonesia[16] on 23 January 2015 and was expected to expand during that year throughout the region. In June 2016, OnePlus decided to pull out of the Indonesian market due to local regulations for imported 4G smartphones restricting sales of the OnePlus 2.[17]</p>
