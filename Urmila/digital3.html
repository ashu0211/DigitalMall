<h2>History</h2>
1958–1960s
In 1958, LG Electronics was founded as GoldStar (Hangul:금성). It was established in the aftermath of the Korean War to provide the rebuilding nation with domestically-produced consumer electronics and home appliances. LG Electronics produced South Korea's first radios, TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners. GoldStar was one of the LG groups with a brethren company, Lak-Hui (pronounced "Lucky") Chemical Industrial Corp. which is now LG Chem and LG Households. GoldStar merged with Lucky Chemical and LS Cable on 28 February 1995, changing the corporate name to Lucky-Goldstar, and then finally to LG Electronics.
<br><br><br>
1970s–1990s
LG Electronics earned US$100 million in revenue from exports for the first time in its history. Rapid growth by globalization saw the company establish its first overseas production, based in the United States, in 1982. In 1994, GoldStar officially adopted the LG Electronics brand and a new corporate logo. LG Electronics acquired the US-based TV manufacturer Zenith. In 1995, LG Electronics made the world's first CDMA digital mobile handsets and supplied Ameritech and GTE in the US. The company was also awarded UL certification in the US.[8] In 1998, LG developed the world's first 60-inch plasma TV, and in 1999 established a joint venture with Philips – LG.Philips LCD – which now goes by the name LG Display.
<br><br><br>
2000–present
In order to create a holding company, the former LG Electronics was split off in 2002, with the "new" LG Electronics being spun off and the "old" LG Electronics changing its name to LG EI. It was then merged with and into LG CI in 2003 (the legal successor of the former LG Chem), so the company that started as Goldstar does not currently exist.
<br><br><br>
LG Electronics plays a large role in the global consumer electronics industry; it was the second-largest LCD TV manufacturer worldwide as of 2013.[9] By 2005, LG was a Top 100 global brand, and in 2006 LG recorded a brand growth of 14%.[10] Its display manufacturing affiliate, LG Display, as of 2009 was the world's largest LCD panel manufacturer.[11] In 2010, LG Electronics entered the smartphone industry. Since, LG Electronics continued to develop various electronic products, such as releasing the world's first 84-inch ultra-HD TV for retail sale.[12]
<br><br><br>
On 5 December 2012, the antitrust regulators of the European Union fined LG Electronics and five other major companies (Samsung, Thomson since 2010 known as Technicolor, Matsushita which today is Panasonic Corp, Philips, and Toshiba) for fixing prices of TV cathode-ray tubes in two cartels lasting nearly a decade.[13]

On 11 June 2015, LG Electronics found itself in the midst of a human rights controversy when The Guardian published an article by Rosa Moreno, a former employee of an LG television assembly factory.[14]
<br><br><br>
At the end of 2016, LG Electronics merged its German branch (situated in Ratingen) and European headquarter (situated in London) together in Eschborn a suburb of Frankfurt am Main.[15]
<br><br><br>
In March 2017, LG Electronics was sued for its handling of hardware failures with recent smartphones such as the LG G4.[16]
<br><br><br>
In July 2018 Koo Bon-joon who was the CEO then the vice chairman.[17] was replaced by his nephew implementing "first son-only succession rule".[18] Also involved under the same rule is the present CEO of LG Corporation (the parent company) Koo Kwang-mo succeeding his father Koo Bon-moo who died of a brain tumor on May 20, 2018.[19]</p>
