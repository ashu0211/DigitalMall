<p>This is a list of headphone manufacturers. A headphone is a pair of small loudspeakers that are designed to be held in place close to a user's ears. They are also known as earspeakers, earphones[1] or, colloquially, cans.[2] The alternate in-ear versions are known as earbuds or earphones.[1] In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of headphone and microphone. Headphones either have wires for connection to a signal source such as an audio amplifier, radio, CD player, portable media player, mobile phone, video game consoles, electronic musical instrument, or have a wireless device, which is used to pick up signal without using a cable.

AKG Acoustics (originally Akustische und Kino-Geräte Gesellschaft m.b.H., English: Acoustic and Cinema Equipment) was an acoustics engineering and manufacturing company founded in 1947 by Dr. Rudolf Görike and Ernest Plass, and headquartered in Vienna, Austria. AKG now exists only as a brand owned by the South Korean firm Samsung Electronics and managed by Harman International Industries.

The products currently marketed under the AKG brand mostly consist of microphones, headphones, wireless audio systems and related accessories for professional and consumer markets.

Audio-Technica was established in 1962 in Tokyo, Japan, by Hideo Matsushita as a phonograph cartridge manufacturer. Its first products were the AT-1 and the AT-3 MM stereo phono cartridges. Business rapidly developed and Audio-Technica expanded into other fields.[1]

In 2008, the company celebrated the 20th anniversary of supplying microphones for US Presidential Debates. For their 50th anniversary, Audio-Technica celebrated at Consumer Electronics Show 2012, debuting their AT-LP1240-USB USB DJ Turntable[2] and ATH-CKS55i.[3] Their booth also featured a dubstep dance video, "Audio 911",[4] by dancer Marquese "Nonstop" Scott produced by video production company The DVI Group.[5]<br><br><br>

<h2>Technology</h2><br>
One of their most famous products was a battery-operated, portable record player called Mister Disc that was sold in the U.S. in the early 1980s.[citation needed]

In 2005, Audio-Technica developed "Uniguard", a method for making microphones resistant to radio frequency interference from cell phones, Bluetooth devices, wireless computer networks and walkie-talkies. 13 patents were involved in bringing the feature to fruition, as company engineers modified many different elements of microphone construction and operation. Over 50 existing Audio-Technica microphone models have been upgraded with the new RFI-resistant technology.[11][12][13]
